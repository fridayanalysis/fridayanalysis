## 📂 Projects

### Cyclists Membership Acquisition

This project was a case study for the Google Data Analytics Certificate through Coursera. I worked on the first part of the analysis, looking at the last 12 months of rider data to see what makes casual riders different from members.

Here are the main things I found:
1. Casual riders take longer rides than members.
2. Casual riders ride more on weekends, while members ride more during the week.
3. Some stations have a big gap in usage by casual riders, which could be a chance to convert them to members.
4. Casual riders are almost twice as likely to return their bikes to the same station they rented them from.

### Bellabeat Project

This project was my second case study for the Google Data Analytics Certificate through Coursera. I again was tasked with a smaller portion of the entire analysis where I was tasked with looking at FitBit user data to gain insights on usage and information for competitor Bellabeats.

My main finding was that sedentary users had impacted sleep.

I suggested that Bellabeat implement this knowledge in their marketing and created expert appeal as they discouraged sedentary lifestyles to boost sleep performance.
